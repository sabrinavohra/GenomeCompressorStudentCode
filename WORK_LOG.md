| 11/12 |  10:30 - 10:40am  |                                   I started thinking through the code and deciding how to approach the compress() method. |
| 11/12 |   9:30 - 9:40pm   |                    I wrote pseudocode about how to approach the problem using a hashing technique to compress and expand. |
| 11/13 | 12:05am - 12:30am |                                                          I worked on solving compress() using hashing as a basic concept. |
| 11/13 | 10:50 -  11:10am  | I worked on writing some more pseudocode to approach solving compress() and expand() to figure out how to use a hash map. |
| 11/13 |   1:15 - 1:45pm   |                                                     I worked on using the in-class method to solve the compress() method. |
