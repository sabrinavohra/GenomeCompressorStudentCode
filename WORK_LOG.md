| 11/12 |  10:30 - 10:40am  |                I started thinking through the code and deciding how to approach the compress() method. |
| 11/12 |   9:30 - 9:40pm   | I wrote pseudocode about how to approach the problem using a hashing technique to compress and expand. |
| 11/13 | 12:05am - 12:30am |                                       I worked on solving compress() using hashing as a basic concept. |
